# Natural-Language-Processing-Analysis

This is a project to see how natural language processing tools affect the accuracy of a classifer correctly predicting the number of stars
that each Yelp Review actually received.

The Final Report contains data on how different processsing tools affected the accuracy of the classifer.

The python notebook file contains the source code for the most optimal combinations that we found for each type of classifier.
There is also a html file of the python notebook file after all the code has been ran.

The project_source contains the source code for training a classifer with every tool that has been applied in this project.
